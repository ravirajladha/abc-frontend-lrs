# ABC Learning Platform - Frontend (React, Laravel, MySQL, FFmpeg)

## Introduction
The ABC Learning Platform is an innovative e-learning solution designed to empower students and professionals to achieve their career goals, inspired by platforms like Udemy. Built for ABC Technologies, it serves over **10,000 students** with features like course subscriptions, interactive video lessons, assessments, an inbuilt code editor, Q&A forums, certificate generation, and job/internship opportunities. This repository contains the frontend, developed using **React.js**, providing a dynamic, responsive interface. The backend, built with **Laravel** and **MySQL**, is available at [abc-backend-lrs](https://github.com/ravirajladha/abc-backend-lrs). Developed at KODS.Tech, this project showcases my expertise in frontend development, API integration, and UX design, complementing my portfolio projects like `DigitalDoctorClinic` and `VishvinStockManagement`.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x
- NPM
- Backend server (see [abc-backend-lrs](https://github.com/ravirajladha/abc-backend-lrs))

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravirajladha/abc-frontend-lrs.git
   cd abc-frontend-lrs
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/ravirajladha/abc-frontend-lrs.git
   cd abc-frontend-lrs
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
     ```bash
     copy .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update `.env` with backend API URL:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
     ```
4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Access at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Using .gitignore
- The `.gitignore` file excludes sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `node_modules`).
- Apply it:
  ```bash
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
  ```
  On Windows:
  ```powershell
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
  ```
- Remove tracked sensitive files:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached .env
  git rm --cached node_modules/*
  git commit -m "Remove sensitive files"
  ```
